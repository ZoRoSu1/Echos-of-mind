        <h2>Dive into words, savor worlds.</h2>

            Steve<br>
            I hurt me. 3 words I still cannot understand it. I can hear the whispering again! Those voices in my head are telling me things, confusing me. I can’t focus. My thoughts are bloody and bleeding, and blood is bleeding all over my mind. I can’t sleep anymore; all I see is darkness… Am I dying because I can’t see the stars? Where are they? I'm surely dead, and I am stuck in this constant battle. I'm freezing. Those walls can’t stop staring at me. I need help! "Please, I need to get out of here." All I need is a sword to open my skull and get rid of those voices. It’s been 3 months since I was locked in this room. I still don’t know why. I sit next to the window and took my book. At least, I find peace in reading… Then the door opened, and it was her…<br>
          
            Stella<br>
            Finally! It’s the deadline. I'm officially starting my job as a psychiatrist in the most popular mental health facility. I've been waiting for this day for years. It was my dream job since my mother died when I was so young, and I couldn’t understand why she died. She used to be optimistic and in a good mood most of the time. They told me that she suffered from a certain disease named schizophrenia – a severe mental health disorder. People with it often experience difficulties in distinguishing between what is real and what is not. From that moment, I decided to be a psychiatrist because it’s not fair to see the most close people to you dying even if they seem healthy. Her death was a terrible part of my life, and I promised myself to help those poor people who deserve to live in the way they prefer.<br>
          
            I was so excited to meet my first patient, and I hope he or she will appreciate me.<br>
          
            Once I arrived at the center, I met the director Jack, a young man with a black suit; he is on his thirteenth, maybe. "It’s my honor to meet you, Mrs. Jack," I said. "Oh! Welcome to our center, Dr. Stella. Finally, we met. My colleague told how competent you are. I'm so eager to see you proving it." "I'm over the moon, Mrs. Jack. You will not be disappointed." "So, this is Jules—a young woman with blond hair and a cute face. She will lead you to your new office. Wish you the best, Mrs. Stella." "Thank you, Mrs. Jack," and he went away; he was precipitate. Maybe he has some urgent work. Then the young girl Jules asked me, "I guess you're the new doctor, right? I guess it’s Stella Bloom, right?" OMG, how I feel proud of myself when they talk to me as a doctor, I nod, "Yes, I am Stella. Nice to meet you, Jules." "Nice to meet you too," she said, "Before we go to your office, I have to show you the details of this center." I was so excited, "Of course, that’s so kind."<br>
          
            Then when we were on the first floor, she said, "It’s dedicated to the young patients whose age is between 10 and 17." I felt so sad to see young children suffering from these kinds of illnesses instead of living. A few moments later, we were on the second floor, which is totally different from the other. It was really large and so calm; all the rooms were open, and I could see some patients. Most of them were sleeping, except one room; it was locked. I asked Jules, "What’s the matter with that room?" She said, "Oh, better off you not know." "What do you mean?" She nods, "It's room 45; it’s dedicated to one patient. And last week..." then she tried to speak softer, "Last week, he tried to suicide." I was shocked, "What! Suicide… but why?" "No one knows. His last doctor just gave his dismissal without explanation... It was really terrible. Is there anyone who tried to search more into his situation?" "No, of course. No one of the doctors tried to take a look at his situation." Then I took some seconds to think and rationed, and I heard Jules’s voice, "Don’t tell me you are going to be his doctor." "Why not, it’s my job, and also he is a human being, and he has the right to live." "Seriously, Stella, it’s your first day. Try to start with something casual and fluent." "Don’t worry, Jules; there’s nothing to fear."<br>
          
            I knocked the door of the room twice, but there was no response. I took a deep breath and stepped into the room. A mix of excitement and a touch of nervousness settled in. The room was adorned with muted colors. He was sitting next to the window, reading a book. He was so charming; the soft sunlight streaming through the window was casting a warm glow on his face. And I felt that I saw him somewhere, but I can’t remember. However, he is my first patient.<br>
          
            Steve<br>
            It’s all déjà vu. Yes! It’s her. I'm sure it’s Stella, but how! Does she really did it! Her dream job became true? I'm shocked. I can’t be sure if it’s her or not; but it’s surely Stella with her long wavy hair, her shiny smile, and her gorgeous eyes. But the question is how?<br>
          
            Stella<br>
            “Good afternoon; how are you doing?” I said gently. He stared at me with those eyes that reminded me of someone, but I can’t clearly know who it is. And he continued his reading. “I'm Dr. Bloom, your new doctor.” And this time I heard his voice, “My doctor... what a shame.” Honestly, it’s complicated. Obviously, he might have trust issues, and building trust in therapy takes time. So, it’s important to make him feel comfortable talking with me. I tried again but in a different way. “You are a reader, aren’t you? I’ve always found solace in the pages of a good book. It’s like entering a different world. Don’t you think so?” I thought he wasn’t going to answer, but he did; finally, he did. “Yeah, you got a point of view. It’s one of the few things that can distract me from the constant shatter in my head,” he said with a smooth voice. “Books do have a unique way of transporting us. Any particular genres or authors that you find comforting?” I asked thoughtfully. “Science fiction; I do like science fiction. It takes my mind off things,” he said enthusiastically. And at that moment, I knew I have to leave. It’s better to leave him alone now. I nod, “I think I'm gonna enjoy talking to you later....” And before I finished, he interrupted me, “Steve, my name is Steve Russo.” I was shocked; I found myself in disbelief. There is no way it’s him. Steve Russo used to be my best friend. But how did he end up here? This place doesn’t suit him at all. I can’t find a way to link things right now. I took a deep breath; he obviously didn’t notice who I am. However, the fact that I know him very well is gonna help me to make him feel safe and transparent about his intentions and decisions. I think my first step is to show him that I'm interested in his hobbies and his way of thinking.<br>
          
            Steve<br>
            They say time heals, but no, time forgets. It’s been 16 years since I met Stella, but here we are; she can’t even remember the one who has always been by her side, regardless of what happened. I wasn’t only her refuge, but I was also the shoulder she could rely on. We were best friends, like the stars in the dark sky. She used to bring happiness, warmth, and brighten up my life, just like the sun. But we got separated after she demanaged with her father after her mother’s death. She was the one who needed my help. But it’s not the case anymore; it’s me who needs her by my side, and she will without even noticing. The whispering is back; oh, not now. I.... I want to get out of here.... I can see it again. Everything is blurry; no... It’s dark. Where am I?... Voices... voices in my head.... No, please. It’s enough... Why does it happen to me every time?... I try to live peacefully. Please.<br>
          
            Stella<br>
            He was lying on his bed; he looked so tired. His face was pale, like if he didn’t eat a plate since a while. Once his eyes met mine, he smiled, but I felt it was a sad smile. He’s suffering from something. He wants to escape from something, but he can’t. That’s my mission. “Stella, you came back,” he said. He tried to get up, but he seemed very weak. I sat near to his bed. “Of course I am; did you think I wouldn’t come?” I said with an intention that he has been through so many troubles of being betrayed, surely from the one close to him. “Yeah, it’s just... I wasn’t expecting you back. All the previous doctors lost interest after their first session with me... maybe I am the problem.” “Oh Steve! Let’s say I am a bit different, in a good way.” He stared at me with his credentials eyes as if he found an intecell of hope and safety on what I have said. “And guess what I bring you,” I said with excitement, handing him the box. “Oh, new books. It’s exactly what I need in this place. How did you know... omg! Stella... I can’t find the exact words... I am—” he talked with an immense happiness like a little boy who just found some candy. “Glad you like it, Steve. You told me you like science fiction books. Most of these are on your taste.” Actually, I lied; he was my best friend, of course, I know what kind of books he prefers without even telling me. I still remember how he used to like reading; each time he finished a book, he became so excited and impatient to talk about it. “Maybe you didn’t pay attention, but you kind of gave me protection,” he said with a voice. “What do you mean? From what do you need to be protected?” “... From me.” His answers made blood stop flowing in my veins, but I tried to hide it. “So, books just help you?” “Yeah, their silence doesn’t demand anything.” I was at the point to tell him that he can trust me and that I can listen to his thoughts, but it’s too soon. Step by step, he himself will tell me.<br>
          
            Steve<br>
            In English, we call it overthinking, and in poetry, it’s "the storms in my head that ruin the garden that my soul holds." I never thought it would be like this; I confess to the unseen audience. The weight of my emotions spills into the room. Why is it too hard to make sense of everything? This room became a canvas for the unspoken, a space where the words I dare not share with others find their fleeting existence. And so, I sit alone, engaged in a silent dialogue with my own mind.<br>
          
            Stella<br>
            In the calm solitude of the room, Steve sat in a comfortable chair next to the window. He appeared engrossed in a dialogue with his own thoughts. As the murmured words escape, each syllable carries the height of an internal narrative. The tone was hushed, as if he is sharing secrets with an audience he’s the only one who can see. “What a nice weather to start a day,” I said while I was opening the window. “Let’s take a break from these usual sessions in this boring room; maybe we should go to the yard. What do you think?” “No, I don’t like full places,” he said with a deep conviction. “Come on, Steve; let’s just try it. You’ll change your mind.” I didn’t wait for his answer, and I left the room. Moments later, he was with me in the yard; the sunlight streamed through the leaves as we settled on a bench. With a warm smile, I suggested playing a little game. “Let’s delve into a different kind of conversation, truth or dare!” We used to play this game a lot when we were younger; I still remember how we were enjoying life even with these little things. It was simple and too clear. “Truth: can you share a cherished memory from your childhood that never fails to bring a smile to your face?” I tried to start with a simple question to make things easier for him. He hesitated at first, but then he said, “It was a Sunday morning, and I was taking breakfast—some cereals with milk—with a friend. Then she said a joke, and we started laughing very hard to the point the milk came from my nose.” I still remember that memory; it was who said the joke ("What did one wall say to the other wall? I will meet you on the corner.") It’s stupid now, but we were children; of course, it made us laugh. “Oh, that seems funny; it’s your turn now. Ask me whatever you want.” He stayed silent for a moment, then he surprised me with his strange question, “What does life mean to you?” I knew at that second that my answer could change everything for the best or the worst. “It’s about finding purpose, spreading happiness, and making an impact in the world.” “And what if we can’t find the purpose?” he said with a “Of course, we can find a purpose to live.” “No, you are totally wrong. Life is a waste of time; we don’t have the right to live... I don’t have the right to live... the problem is me...” he talked with a terrifying voice, like if he is not the one who was talking before. I knew, "This person is not Steve; I don’t know him."<br>
